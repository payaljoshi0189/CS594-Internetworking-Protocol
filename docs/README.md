# About
This project demonstrates the use of a multi-client IRC chat application

The server and the client have been written in [Python3](https://docs.python.org/3/). The previous versions of python
    are not supported.

We have references the module [Interprocess Communication and Networking](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipc.html)
    for allowing us to enable a communication among clients 

We have tried to follow the best practices for python projects[Python best practices](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/)

In regards to following best practices we took an approach to make use of markdown files to document some of our work
